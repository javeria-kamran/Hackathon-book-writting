# Product Specification: "The Guide to Modern Agentic Development: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics"

## 1. Book Identity
- **Book Name:** The Guide to Modern Agentic Development: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
- **Goal:** Create a comprehensive, Docusaurus-based textbook covering the provided course outline.

## 2. Core Content Requirements

### 2.1. Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this book, the reader will be able to:
1.  Understand the core principles of agentic AI and their application in robotics.
2.  Set up and manage a development environment for physical AI using ROS 2 and NVIDIA Isaac SDK.
3.  Design, simulate, and test robotic systems in Gazebo.
4.  Implement computer vision and perception pipelines for robotic tasks.
5.  Develop navigation and manipulation behaviors for a humanoid robot.
6.  Integrate multiple robotic sub-systems to complete a complex autonomous task.
