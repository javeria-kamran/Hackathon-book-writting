# Technical Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the technical plan to create the Docusaurus-based online book, "The Guide to Modern Agentic Development," as specified in `.specify/memory/spec.md`. The implementation will strictly adhere to the principles in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## 2. Docusaurus Content Structure

### 2.1. Weekly Modules File Structure
- A new directory `docs/course-modules` will be created to house all course content.
- Inside `docs/course-modules`, 13 subdirectories will be created: `week-1`, `week-2`, ..., `week-13`, corresponding to the weekly breakdown in the spec.
- Each `week-N` directory will contain an `index.md` file as the landing page and a `_category_.json` file to configure the sidebar label (e.g., `{"label": "Week N: Topic"}`).

### 2.2. Hardware Documentation
- A new standalone file, `docs/hardware-requirements.md`, will be created.
- This file will contain the detailed specifications for the "Digital Twin Workstation," "Edge Kit," and "Robot Lab Options."

## 3. Sidebar Configuration (`sidebars.js`)
- The `sidebars.js` file will be updated to reflect the new content structure.
- A link to the `hardware-requirements.md` document will be added near the top of the sidebar.
- A new sidebar category named "Course Modules" will be created. This category will use Docusaurus's `autogenerated` feature to automatically create sidebar entries for the 13 weekly modules from the `docs/course-modules` directory.

## 4. TypeScript Conversion
- In adherence to the "Technical Platform Principle," existing JavaScript configuration files will be converted to TypeScript.
- This includes renaming `docusaurus.config.js` to `docusaurus.config.ts` and `sidebars.js` to `sidebars.ts`.
- The contents of these files will be updated to be valid TypeScript, including importing necessary types from Docusaurus.
- Dependencies required for TypeScript support in Docusaurus (e.g., `@docusaurus/module-type-aliases`, `typescript`) will be added to `package.json` if not already present.

## 5. High-Level Implementation Steps
1.  **Scaffold Directories:** Create the `docs/course-modules` directory and 13 weekly subdirectories.
2.  **Create Hardware Doc:** Create and populate the `docs/hardware-requirements.md` file.
3.  **Convert to TypeScript:** Check dependencies, rename config files, and update their syntax.
4.  **Update Sidebar:** Modify the newly renamed `sidebars.ts` to add the hardware link and autogenerate the course modules sidebar.
5.  **Create Placeholders:** Add placeholder `index.md` and `_category_.json` files to each weekly module directory.
6.  **Verify:** Run the Docusaurus development server to ensure all changes work correctly.
